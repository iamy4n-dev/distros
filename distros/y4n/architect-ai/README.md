# y4n/architect-ai

A development environment for software architects who rely on AI agents for code exploration, codebase understanding, and technical decision-making.

## What's included

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `fish-config` | Fish shell — optimised for navigation and exploration, not script execution |
| `node-runtime` | Node.js LTS via nvm — required by all AI agent CLIs |
| `cli-essentials` | Core tools: fzf, ripgrep, bat, jq, eza, zoxide, atuin |
| `tui-power` | TUI tools: lazygit and friends for fast terminal navigation |
| `ai-agent-claude` | Anthropic's Claude Code — agentic, whole-codebase reasoning |
| `ai-agent-codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI — lightweight terminal coding agent |
| `ai-agent-opencode` | OpenCode — open-source, multi-provider AI coding agent |
| `ai-agent-pi` | Pi Coding Agent — autonomous code understanding and generation |

## Philosophy

A software architect rarely executes builds or runs tests directly — they navigate, explore, and reason. This distro is optimised for that mode of work:

- **Fish shell** for interactive navigation (abbreviations, autosuggestions, no POSIX baggage)
- **CLI essentials** for fast file search and exploration (fzf, ripgrep, bat)
- **Multiple AI agents** so you can pick the right model for each task — Claude for deep reasoning, Codex for quick edits, OpenCode for multi-provider flexibility, Pi for autonomous exploration

## Usage

```yaml
# dpod.yaml
distro: y4n/architect-ai@v0.3.2
```

Run `dpod-seed sync` to materialise the environment.
